# DFA_Minimizer
Welcome to the DFA Minimizer tool! This simple tool allows you to enter a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) and performs the minimization process on it. The language used in the DFA is {0,1}, and the states numbering starts from q0.
## Usage
Once you have the DFA Minimizer set up, you can start using it by following these steps:

1- Run the DFA Minimizer program.
2- Enter the DFA details when prompted. Ensure that the DFA follows the specified language and state numbering conventions.
3- Once you have entered the DFA, the program will perform the minimization process automatically.
4- After the minimization is complete, the program will display the minimized DFA.
